What is the computer architecture?
	The interface between computer's software and hardware.
	
Significance of Computer Architecture
	Low -> High
	
	Electronic elements( Current, Voltage, Power..)
	
	CMOS Transistors
		-Depending high or low voltage it turns certain component on or off.
		
	Digital Logic(Hardware) Design
		-Logic gate design of simple hardware.
		-State machines
	
	Computer Architecture
		-Connect hardware to software
		
	Binary Machine code
		
	Assembly Language
	
	High-level languages
	
	Software Engineering
		-Programming apps
		
What is MIPS?
	Microprocessor without interlocked Pipeline Stages
	
Electric Current
	Current: rate of flow of electrons through time
	
	What causes electrons to travel?
		- voltage
		
	Voltage
		-The amount of electrical potential energy to move an electron.
		- Electron wants to move towards a high EPE
		- Electron movement from low to high voltage
		
	Current
		-Flow from positively charged particles.
		-High to low voltage.
		

CMOS transistor operation
	2 types
		-NMOS
		-PMOS
		
	NMOS transistor:
		- Binary switch that's closed if Gate voltage is High and Source voltage is Low.
		-When closed, Drain and Source are connected and current can flow from Drain to Source.
		- Drain to Source
		
	PMOS transistor:
		-A binary switch that's closed if Gate voltage is Low and Source voltage is High.
		-Source high
		-Drain low
		
	Voltage Difference causes current to flow.
	
	Output voltage is OPPOSITE of Input voltage.

	Bubble in front of Buffer is the inverter.
	
LOGIC GATES
boolean algebra
	-can only be 0 or 1

AND gate
A*B*C
* is boolean algebra

OR gate
A+B
+ is boolean algebra

NAND gate
(A*B*C)'
opposite of AND gate

NOR gate
(A+B)'
opposite of OR gate

XOR gate
A(+)B(+)C
-exclusive or
-checks if odd number of high inputs

XNOR gate
(A(+)B(+)C)'
-checks if even number of high inputs

Boolean Algebra

	Primary vs Dual
	Change value 0 or 1 to it's opposite.
